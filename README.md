# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to provide V. Isualize with analysis of how city type influences ride share data.

The data shows that there are more rides, drivers, and total fares within an urban environment. This is to be expected with a larger population density. The opposite is shown with average fare per ride and average fare per driver both of which are largest in a rural environment. Again this is to be expected as a lower density would suggest a further distance to travel to get to a destination. The average fare per driver gap between city type is by the surplus of drivers in an urban environment. As a result some drivers didn't have a ride within this the period of analysis. 


##Summary
The disparities across city type is a result of population density. The business model is working as expected. It would make no sense to address the discrepancies. If the CEO does want to address the discrepancies caused by population dynamics here are three options. 
1. The CEO might want to consider reducing the number of drivers in an urban location to ensure every driver gets one ride. This would increase the average fare per driver making it more desirable to be a driver. However it may cause delays for the consumer and drivers are not salary employees so having a surplus of drivers is not an expense to the company. 
2. The company could increase marketing in rural and suburban evironments to increase rides and drivers in the the surburban environment. 
3. The company could increase surge pricing of urban environments to increase the average fare per ride.
